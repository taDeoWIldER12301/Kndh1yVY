# 🎇 Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to the Cloud-101 . We welcome contributions from all

skill levels. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, your help is valuable to us. Here are some guidelines to get you started:

## 💻 Before Contributing

Before sending your contributions, please read these guidelines thoroughly. If you have any doubts, don't hesitate to reach out.

## 🙌 Contribution

We accept contributions of all kinds, from small bug fixes to significant feature additions. Please follow these steps to contribute:

### 🔖 Steps to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine.
3. **Add an upstream link** to the main branch in your cloned repository:
   ```
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/dscpesu/Cloud-101.git
   ```
4. **Keep your fork up to date** by pulling from upstream (this avoids merge conflicts later):
   ```
   git pull upstream main https://github.com/dscpesu/Cloud-101.git
   ```
5. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```
   git checkout -b <feature-name>
   ```
6. Make your changes, add and commit them:
   ```
   git commit -m "Write a meaningful but concise commit message"
   ```
7. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```
8. Create a **Pull Request (PR)** on GitHub. Make sure to provide a clear and detailed description of your changes and why they are necessary.

### 🔨 Note

- Please avoid editing or deleting someone else's code in this repository. You can only insert new files/folders.
- Give meaningful names to the files or folders you add (e.g., `your-feature-name.<sh/tf/...>`).
- Always create a PR from a branch other than `main`.
- Make sure your solution is better in terms of performance and other parameters compared to the previous work.
- We encourage learning and growth, so don't hesitate to ask for help or guidance from mentors or the community.

## 🧲 Pull Request Review Criteria

1. Fill out the **[PR Template]** properly when creating a Pull Request.
2. Add your code (e.g., `.<sh/tf/...>` files) to the respective folders.
3. Ensure that your work is original, not copied from other sources.
4. Comment your code where necessary.
5. For frontend changes, share screenshots and work samples before sending a PR.
6. Follow proper [style guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) for your work.
7. Feel free to discuss any queries or issues with us.

## 📍 Other Points to Remember

We aim to make your work readable by others, so please consider the following:

- Use snake_case for your file and folder names.
- Avoid creating new directories if possible; try to fit your work into the existing structure.
- The basic project folder should have two subfolders: Dataset and Model.
- The `README.md` file should be concise and clear about the project's purpose.
- Document your work briefly to help others understand it.
